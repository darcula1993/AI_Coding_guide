# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an AI coding collaboration guide written in Chinese, structured as a comprehensive tutorial for developers learning to work effectively with AI coding assistants. The project consists of educational content organized into chapters covering different aspects of AI-assisted development.

## Content Structure

The guide follows a progressive learning approach:

1. **Core Concepts (01-introduction.md)**: Establishes AI as a collaborative partner rather than replacement, emphasizing incremental development and version control
2. **Project Setup (02-project-setup.md)**: Architecture-first approach, AI-friendly initialization workflows, and standardized development environments  
3. **Version Control (03-version-control.md)**: Risk management strategies, small commit principles, and collaborative workflows specific to AI-assisted development
4. **Communication (04-communication.md)**: Effective interaction patterns, context management, and structured code review processes

## Key Principles Embedded in Content

- **Incremental Development**: Break complex requirements into manageable steps rather than attempting large implementations at once
- **Context Management**: Provide sufficient project background and technical constraints when requesting AI assistance  
- **Risk Control**: Emphasize human review, version control safety nets, and controlled change scope
- **Collaborative Patterns**: Frame AI interactions as partnerships requiring clear communication and iterative refinement

## Content Guidelines

When working with this educational content:

- Maintain the practical, example-driven approach with real code samples and dialogue patterns
- Preserve the Chinese language and technical terminology consistency
- Keep the balance between theoretical concepts and actionable guidance
- Examples should reflect realistic development scenarios rather than oversimplified cases

## Repository Standards

- All content files use Markdown format with Chinese text
- Code examples within content should follow the technical stacks mentioned (Python/Flask, JavaScript/React, etc.)
- Maintain consistent formatting for dialogue examples and code blocks throughout chapters
